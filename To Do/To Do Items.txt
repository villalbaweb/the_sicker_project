* Fix the VisualEffectHandler.cs issue where it instantiate the VFX 
in favor of use the Object Pool. At the same time I have to Refactor the 
VisualEffect.cs so instead of Destroy a VFX it will set inactive to work
properly with Object Pool. With this change the TemporaryGameObjectsHandler.cs
object is not required anymore.
