* Fix the VisualEffectHandler.cs issue where it instantiate the VFX 
in favor of use the Object Pool. At the same time I have to Refactor the 
VisualEffect.cs so instead of Destroy a VFX it will set inactive to work
properly with Object Pool. With this change the TemporaryGameObjectsHandler.cs
object is not required anymore.

1.- Identify which Prefabs are using the VisualEffectHandler.cs and which 
Visual Effect is using.

Projectile                          - Lazer Ray Hit Effect  -   Has VisualEffect.cs component
Player                              - Explosion VFX  -   Has VisualEffect.cs component
Orange Spaceship                    - Explosion VFX  -   Has VisualEffect.cs component
Capsule Spaceship                   - Explosion VFX  -   Has VisualEffect.cs component 
Follow On Distance Attacker         - Enemy Cell Explosion Particle System  -   Has VisualEffect.cs component
Follow On Distance Small Attacker   - Small Enemy Cell Explosion Particle System  -   Has VisualEffect.cs component
Follower On Distance Explosive      - Enemy Cell Explosion Particle System  -   Has VisualEffect.cs component

2.- Setup those VFX in Object Pool system.
2.a.- Create VfxPooledObject.cs

3.- Refactor VisualEffectHandler.cs to use the proper Object Pool Id of the 
Visual Effect.

4.- Refactor VisualEffect.cs (probably change its name) so it SetActive(false) the visuals from the 
Object Pool system.

5.- Remove TemporaryGameObjectsHandler.cs related components since the objects will not
be instantiated anylonger during gameplay, Object Pool will handle that.
